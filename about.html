Mu close friends, family on holidays, and high school teamates. The only thing that is rare to catch in front of the lense is me!</p></div>

            <p>I have always loved taking pictures of people, my friends, family, but especially kids. I had the opportunity to volunteer at a nutrition house in Panama with kids 0-3, and taking their portraits is where that love began. Since I have enjoyed taking pictures of kids all ages, but especially babies.</p>
